    "## A re-Tweet Graph\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, we're going to adapt the classic HITS approach to allow us to find not the most authoritative web pages, but rather to find significant Twitter users. So, instead of viewing the world as web pages with hyperlinks (where pages = nodes, hyperlinks = edges), we're going to construct a graph of Twitter users and their retweets of other Twitter users (so user = node, retweet of another user = edge). Over this Twitter-user graph, we can apply the HITS approach to order the users by their hub-ness and their authority-ness.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a toy example. Suppose you are given the following four retweets:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **userID**: diane, **text**: \"RT \", **sourceID**: bob\n",
    "* **userID**: charlie, **text**: \"RT Welcome\", **sourceID**: alice\n",
    "* **userID**: bob, **text**: \"RT Hi \", **sourceID**: diane\n",
    "* **userID**: alice, **text**: \"RT Howdy!\", **sourceID**: parisa\n",
    "\n",
    "There are four short tweets retweeted by four users. The retweet between users form a directed graph with five nodes and four edges. E.g., the \"diane\" node has a directed edge to the \"bob\" node.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should build a graph by parsing the tweets in the file we provide called *HITS.json*.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Notes:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* You may see some weird characters in the content of tweets, just ignore them. \n",
    "* The edges are weighted and directed. If Bob retweets Alice's tweets 10 times, there is an edge from Bob to Alice with weight 10, but there is not an edge from Alice to Bob.\n",
    "* If a user retweets herself, ignore it.\n",
    "* Correctly parsing screen_name in a tweet is error-prone. Use the id of the user (this is the user who is re-tweeting) and the id of the user in the retweeted_status field (this is the user who is being re-tweeted; that is, this user created the original tweet).\n",
    "* Later you will need to implement the HITS algorithm on the graph you build here.\n"

    "For this part, your goal is to put on your \"[search engine optimization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization)\" hat. Your job is to create a webpage that scores highest for the query: **kbeznak parmatonic** --- two terms, lower case, no quote. As of today (Feb 16, 2018), there are no hits for this query on either Google or Bing. Based on our discussions of search engine ranking algorithms, you know that several factors may impact a page's rank. Your goal is to use this knowledge to promote your own page to the top of the list.\n",

    "What we're doing here is a form of [SEO contest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SEO_contest). While you have great latitude in how you approach this problem, you are not allowed to engage in any unethical or illegal behavior. Please read the discussion of \"white hat\" versus \"black hat\" SEO over at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Search_engine_optimization#White_hat_versus_black_hat_techniques).\n",

    "**Rules of the game:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Somewhere in the page (possibly in the non-viewable source html) you must include your name or some other way for us to identify you (e.g., your NetID, but not the UIN!).\n",
    "* Your target page may only be a TAMU student page, a page on your own webserver, a page on a standard blog platform (e.g., wordpress), or some other primarily user-controlled page\n",
    "* Your target page CAN NOT be a twitter account, a facebook page, a Yahoo Answers or similar page\n",
    "* No wikipedia vandalism\n",
    "* No yahoo/wiki answers questions\n",
    "* No comment spamming of blogs\n",
    "* If you have concerns/questions/clarifications, please post on Piazza and we will discuss\n",
    "\n",
    "For your homework turnin for this part, you should provide us the URL of your target page and a brief discussion (2-4 paragraphs) of the strategies you are using. We will issue the query and check the rankings at some undetermined time in the next couple of weeks. You might guess that major search engines take some time to discover and integrate new pages: if I were you, I'd get a target page up immediately.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Grading:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* 5 points for providing a valid URL\n",
    "* 20 points for a well-reasoned discussion of your strategy\n",
    "* 5 points for your page appearing in the search results by Google or Bing (no matter how is the ranking)\n",
    "\n",
    "** Bonus: **\n",
    "* 1 point for your page appearing in the top-20 on Google or Bing\n",
    "* 1 more point for your page appearing in the top-10 on Google or Bing\n",
    "* 1 more point for your page appearing in the top-5 on Google or Bing\n",
    "* 2 more points for your page being ranked first by Google or Bing. And, a vigorous announcement in class, and a high-five for having the top result!"
